# Python packaged for Immich Distribution

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a programming language that I use in [Immich Distribution](https://github.com/nsg/immich-distribution). This repo is used as a dependency of the Immich Distribution project and is not intended for direct consumption.

## Usage

```yaml
stage-snaps:
    - immich-distribution-python/latest/stable
```

Python is installed under `$SNAP/usr/local/bin`
